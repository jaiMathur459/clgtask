                    <p className="mb-2">• M - MongoDB: A NoSQL document database, offering flexibility and scalability for data storage.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">• E - Express.js: A web framework built on Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">• A - Angular: A JavaScript framework for building dynamic user interfaces (UI) with a focus on single-page applications (SPAs).</p>
                    <p>• N - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development.</p>

                    <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Key Differences between MERN & MEAN:</h5>
                    <p className="mb-2">• Frontend Framework: MEAN uses Angular, while MERN utilizes React. Angular is known for its well-defined structure, dependency injection, and two-way data binding, making it suitable for complex and large-scale applications. React, on the other hand, is known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM, offering flexibility and a potentially faster learning curve.</p>
                    <p>• Popularity and Use Cases: MERN has gained more traction in recent years due to React's popularity and ease of use. However, Angular remains a powerful choice for enterprise-level applications requiring a robust and structured development approach.</p>
